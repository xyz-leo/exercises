This is a simple landing page project built as part of the `/exercises/web` repository.

The main goal of this exercise is to strengthen foundational HTML and CSS skills through deliberate practice. It is not meant to be a polished or production-ready product, but rather a small project focused on:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox)
- Typography and spacing fundamentals
- Building responsive sections with minimal code
- Practicing file organization and boilerplate setup

The landing page includes:
- A responsive header with basic navigation
- A "hero" section introducing the product
- A card section highlighting simple features
- A sticky footer that stays in place regardless of content height

This exercise reflects the learning process and was built without frameworks or JavaScript. The purpose is to become fluent and confident with clean markup and structured styling.
