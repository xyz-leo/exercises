# Simple Dark-Themed Calculator (Experimental)

This project is a minimalist, dark-themed calculator built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

It was created as an experimental exercise to practice:

- CSS Grid layout for buttons
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Styling with a consistent UI theme

**Disclaimer:**  
This is a learning experiment, not a production-ready tool. The calculator currently supports basic input handling, but lacks full mathematical logic or error checking.

Located under the `/exercises/web` directory as part of foundational front-end training.
