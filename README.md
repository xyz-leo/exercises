## About

This repository contains a collection of exercises and small projects created for practice, experimentation, and continuous improvement in programming and software development.

## Purpose

- Improve problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and Pythonic code.
- Strengthen frontend development skills with HTML and CSS.
- Learn and solidify backend development using Django.
- Build consistency in writing code and deepen understanding of core programming concepts.

## Main folders

- `web/`: Web development projects using Django, HTML, CSS, and Python.
- `projects/`: Simple projects of all kinds for learning purposes.

## Notes

This repository is purely for personal learning and experimentation purposes. It serves as a way to document progress, revisit concepts, and improve coding skills over time. This repository is not meant for production use. It serves as a personal lab for practice, growth, and experimentation.
